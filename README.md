# ionic-cellar

Ionic-cellar is a sample application that allows you to look up wines by name, view the details of a wine and perform CRUD operations on it.

The client side is built with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) while the REST api are exposed by a server built with [Node.js]() or alternatively one built with [Grails](http://grails.org).

For REST api please refer to [Christophe Coenraets blog](http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/10/creating-a-rest-api-using-node-js-express-and-mongodb/)
